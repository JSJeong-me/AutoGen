            "3. **Assess General Market Condition:**\n",

            "\n",
            "4. **Analyze Data:**\n",
            "   - With the collected data, use Python data science tools (pandas for data structuring and manipulation; matplotlib or seaborn for creating graphs) to create meaningful visualizations such as line graphs of stock price movements over the month, perhaps highlighting days with significant news.\n",
